# Many Labs 4 data cleaning script
# Coder: Rick Klein raklein22@gmail.com
# OSF: https://osf.io/8ccnw/

# Function: Merges data from many sites involved in the project into one
# standardized data file for analysis. Raw data are required to run this script
# (placed under /data/raw_site_data). These contain confidential data thus are
# not available publicly. Contact Rick to obtain data.

# Open the .rproj file in R Studio to avoid setting the working directory. 
# All file paths are relative from the working directory.
